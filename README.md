## ShikderTECH.io

## Portfolio

A static website to host my portfolio. This website contains a list of my skills, projects, educational background and other CV related to my professional life. The website is currently being hosted on Heroku under the domain shikdertech.io (Will soon migrate to AWS EB) and it will be  a central hub for hosting my future projects.

## Architecture
The website is build with Javascript, React and Bootstrap CSS. Everything is divided up into individual components. Components do not rely on any static data. All static datas are in external JS files with Data suffix.
